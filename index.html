            <h1 style="text-align:center;">21st April 2022</h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;">The Boston Celtics finished off their first round series with the Brooklyn Nets in style <br> with a sweep over Kevin Durant and former Celtic, Kyrie Irving. However all was not <br> as easy at it seemed as Scott Foster gave Jayson Tatum his 6th foul in typical <br> Scott Foster fashion, rather harshly. this did set up a nerve wrecking final few minutes <br> of the game, but the C's did not let their lead slip up completely and finished out the <br> stronger of the two teams to give the team a 4-0 win over the Nets on a scoreline of 116-112.</p><p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">26th April 2022</h1>

Congrats Marcus, <br> bring on the playoffs and the Nets!.</p><p></p>
